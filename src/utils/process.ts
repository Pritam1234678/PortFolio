      "I use React to build fast and interactive web applications. It helps me create reusable components, making my code cleaner and easier to manage. With React’s virtual DOM, updates happen efficiently without reloading the whole page. I also use hooks to manage state and side effects, which makes my development process smoother and more modern. React improves both performance and user experience."

      "I use TypeScript to write safer and more reliable code in my projects. It adds static typing to JavaScript, helping me catch errors early during development. TypeScript makes my code easier to understand and maintain, especially in larger applications. It also improves editor support with better autocompletion and refactoring tools. By using TypeScript, I build more robust and scalable web applications with confidence."
