The goal was to closely replicate the look, feel, and animations of the original site using technologies like Three.js for 3D effects, GSAP for animations, and Locomotive Scroll for smooth parallax scrolling.",

One of the key challenges was syncing animations with scroll behavior and making sure performance stayed high even with complex visuals. It gave me hands-on experience in working with modern frontend tools and taught me how to translate creative UI/UX into real, functional code. It was a fun and educational journey that helped sharpen my skills in frontend animation and design replication.",

It showcases how powerful frontend animations can enhance the overall web experience while keeping performance in check.",

From implementing scroll hijacking to rendering abstract visuals with Canvas, every feature was crafted carefully using a clean setup of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project served as a deep dive into animation libraries and helped refine my frontend performance optimization skills."

Lofi brings a calm, serene energy that helps to balance out mental strain, especially when going through a stressful time or being absorbed in work. I wanted there to be a place for users to be absorbed in that feeling of inner peace that can mediate their feelings of stress. I was inspired by Rainmeter and wanted to create a similar aesthetic, thus Lofi Train was born.",
